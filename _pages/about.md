<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am now a first-year PhD student at [AML Lab](https://aml-cityu.github.io/) CityU HK supervised by Prof. [Xiangyu Zhao](https://zhaoxyai.github.io/). Before that, I graduated from Zhejiang University (ZJU) with a bachelor's degree in Geographic Information Science and from Hong Kong University (HKU) with a master's degree in Computer Science.

My research interest includes GeoAI and Recommender System.
